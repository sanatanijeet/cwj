    <?php
        define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!"); // Output is Welcome to W3Schools.com!
        echo GREETING;
    ?>

1. Create a constant with a case-insensitive name:

    <?php
        define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!", true); 
        echo greeting;
    ?>

2. You can also create a constant by using the const keyword.

    <?php
        const MYCAR = "Volvo"; // output is Volvo
        echo MYCAR;
    ?>

3. Different between const and define is:- 

    a. const are always case-sensitive
    b. define() has has a case-insensitive option.
    c. const cannot be created inside another block scope, like inside a function or inside an if statement.
    d. define can be created inside another block scope.

4. PHP Constant Arrays

    <?php
        define("cars", [
            "Alfa Romeo",
            "BMW",
            "Toyota"
        ]);
        echo cars[0]; // Output is Alfa Romeo
    ?>

5. Constants are Global
    Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.
