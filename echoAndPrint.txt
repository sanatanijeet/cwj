                            PHP echo and print Statements
1. echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.
2. The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.
